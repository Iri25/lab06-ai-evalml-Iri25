# machine-learning-algorithms
Python project that contains 3 folders with applications that solve problems through machine learning methods of which 2 with regression and 1 with classification.

## Key concepts:
- machine learning methods
- the method of least squares
- the descending gradient method
- logistic regression method

### The problem: What can make people happy?

It considers the problem of predicting the degree of happiness of the population of the globe using information about various characteristics of the respective population's well-being such as the Gross Domestic Product of the country.
where they live (gross domestic product â€“ GBP), degree of happiness, etc. Using data from 2017 (Package x), a prediction of the degree of happiness is made based on only the Gross Domestic Product or the Gross Domestic Product and the degree of freedom.

### Problem: What kind of flower do you prefer?

Consider the problem of classifying iris flowers into different species such as: setosa, versicolor and virginica. For each flower, characteristics are known such as: the length and width of the sepal, petal length and width. More details about this set can be found at [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). Using this information, it is decided to which species a particular flower belongs.

The [LeastSquares](https://github.com/Iri25/ai-evalml-Iri25/tree/master/LeastSquares) folder contains an application that solves the first problem using the least squares method.

The [DescedingGradient](https://github.com/Iri25/ai-evalml-Iri25/tree/master/DescedingGradient) folder contains an application that solves the first problem using the descending gradient method based on batches and the normalization of the training and test data.


The [LogisticRegression](https://github.com/Iri25/ai-evalml-Iri25/tree/master/LogisticRegression) folder contains an application that solves the second problem using the multiclass classification method using the logistic regression method and using batches in the training and cross-validation process, investigating different loss functions.
